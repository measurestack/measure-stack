# This file specifies files that are *not* uploaded to Google Cloud
# using gcloud. It follows the same syntax as .gitignore, with the addition of
# "#!include" directives (which insert the entries of the given .gitignore-style
# file at that point).
#
# For more information, run:
#   $ gcloud topic gcloudignore
#
.gcloudignore
# If you would like to upload your .git directory, .gitignore file or files
# from your .gitignore file, remove the corresponding line
# below:
.git
.gitignore

# Ignore everything by default
*

# Include only what's needed for Dockerfile
!static/
!package.json
!bun.lockb
!tsconfig.json
!src/
!Dockerfile

# Exclude unnecessary files within included directories

src/**/*.spec.ts
